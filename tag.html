    Once upon a time, there was a clever monkey who lived in a tree with tasty red apples. One day, a hungry crocodile came and asked the monkey for food.The kind monkey shared his apples, and they became friends. The crocodile started visiting every day and became friends with the monkey.
        The crocodile mentioned his wife and how she loved the apples. The monkey happily gave him extra apples to take home. Their friendship grew deeper.
         However, the crocodile’s wife became jealous and wanted to end their friendship. She tricked the crocodile into bringing the monkey to their home, planning to eat him.
        
        She pretended to be sick and claimed that only a monkey’s heart could cure her. The crocodile felt torn between his friend and his wife’s life. He invited the monkey to cross the river but had a hidden plan to kill him.
        
        As they crossed the river, the crocodile revealed his plan. The smart monkey told him that his heart was left in the apple tree and they needed to go back.
        
        The crocodile, eager to save his wife, swam back. The monkey quickly climbed the tree, outsmarting the crocodile.
        
        He told the crocodile to go home and tell his mean wife that he was the silliest crocodile in the whole world.Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
